    What comes in:
          -- a string of characters that contains letters of the alphabet and/or numbers
        What goes out:
          Nothing
        Side effects:
        Prints, in this order, on separate lines,
      -- The string entered by the user
      -- The length of the string entered by the user
      -- The number of alphabetic characters in the string
      -- The number of digits (integers 0-9) in the string
      -- The reverse string entered by the user
      -- If the string is a palindrome - it prints, the user entered a
      -- palindrome
      -- If the string is not a palindrome - it prints, the user entered a
      -- normal string
      Nothing else should be printed.

        Examples:
          See the TEST cases for examples.
        Type hints:
          :type string_of_characters: string

    A palindrome is a phrase that reads the same backwards. For example,
    the words eye, madam are palindromes because they read the same
    backwards.

    To implement this function, you need to reverse a string. If you write
    your own method to reverse a string and solve the entire problem, you
    will get 35 points. If you use the provided method
    reverseString(string), you will get 30 points

    Here are some examples:
       string_of_characters = 'eye'
       String entered: eye
       Length of string: 3
       Number of alphabetic characters: 3
       Number of digits: 0
       Reversed string: eye
       The user entered a palindrome

       string_of_characters = 'abc1cba'
       String entered: abc1cba
       Length of string: 7
       Number of alphabetic characters: 6
       Number of digits: 1
       Reversed string: abc1cba
       The user entered a palindrome

       string_of_characters = 'a12b'
       String entered: a12b
       Length of string: 4
       Number of alphabetic characters: 2
       Number of digits: 2
       Reversed string: b21a
       The user entered a normal string
